## Note on Mint's native Robinhood support
Support was added to Mint for Robinhood. Some users are reporting that the native support no longer works. This extension does continue to work, but it will add the Robinhood balance as a _collectible_. If you are able to successfully [add Robinhood to Mint natively](https://help.mint.com/General/888961131/How-do-I-add-a-new-account-in-Mint.htm) the balance will show up under investments. Any changes made to Robinhood or Mint in the future could break this extension.
